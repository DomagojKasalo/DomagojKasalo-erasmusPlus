# **Erasmus+ Competitions - Web Platform for Managing Applications**  

## **Project Overview**  
Erasmus+ Competitions is a web platform designed to modernize and digitize the process of applying for Erasmus+ competitions. The project provides students, teachers, and administrators with an efficient way to access, review, and manage competitions.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Students** can browse available competitions, filter them by status and deadline, and submit their applications.  
- **Teachers** can apply for competitions and track their application status.  
- **Administrators** have full control over the system, including creating, editing, and deleting competitions, as well as reviewing, scoring, and approving/rejecting applications.  

The project was developed as part of the *Agile Project Management* course to simulate real-world project development using agile methodologies.

## **Collaboration and Teamwork**  
The project was developed using **an agile approach**, specifically **Scrum methodology**, where the team divided tasks into sprints and worked collaboratively to complete them.  

### **Roles and Responsibilities**  
- **Backend Development:** Focused on building the REST API, implementing authentication, handling applications, and managing the database.  
- **Frontend Development:** Created the user interface, integrated it with the backend, validated user input, and displayed competition data.  
- **Testing and Debugging:** The system was manually tested using Postman and through direct user interaction on the frontend to ensure functionality.  

Throughout the development process, we used **Trello** for organizing tasks, **GitHub** for version control, and **regular meetings** to sync our progress. Effective communication was key in resolving issues promptly and ensuring successful project completion.
